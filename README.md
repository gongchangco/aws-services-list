# aws-services-list
A table with information of AWS services to help with AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02). This does not guarantee to pass the exam. At least help with memorizing what each AWS services do and what they are used for.

## Notes
* `08/08/2024`: Probably more than a table, figuring out what programming language or tools should to use.
